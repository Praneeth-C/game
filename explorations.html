       <p> During the board game exercise, I learned about collaborating with my peers 
           to develop a proficient idea for a game based solely on various assets that have 
           already been taken. My team was able to make a story, objective, and several
           rules that define how the game is played.

       <p> During the 2D video game exercise, I learned how to code and create such games
           using the Pygame Zero program and discovered various concepts and techniques that
           make the game functional and more interesting, such as clocks, mouse click actions,
           drawing tools, lists, and keyboard controls.
